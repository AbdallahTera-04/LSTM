### 📘 README.md — LSTM Sequence Modeling Project

#### 🧠 Project Overview

This project utilizes a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network for **sequence modeling**. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) suitable for learning long-term dependencies in time series or textual data. The project showcases data preprocessing, model design, training, and evaluation using TensorFlow/Keras.

#### 📁 Project Structure *(Assumed from typical LSTM usage)*

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**

   * Loads sequential or time-series data (e.g., stock prices, sensor readings, or text).
   * Normalizes features and structures input sequences for LSTM compatibility.

2. **Model Building**

   * Defines a sequential LSTM architecture using Keras.
   * Includes layers like `LSTM`, `Dropout`, and `Dense`.

3. **Compilation and Training**

   * Compiles the model with appropriate loss (e.g., MSE for regression or categorical crossentropy).
   * Trains the model on structured sequence input.

4. **Evaluation**

   * Evaluates predictions on a test or validation set.
   * Optionally includes visualizations for loss curves or prediction comparisons.

5. **Prediction**

   * Demonstrates model predictions on unseen sequence data.

#### 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow
   ```

2. **Run the Notebook**

   * Make sure input data is present in the specified format.
   * Execute all cells from top to bottom.

#### 💡 Features

* **LSTM-based sequence modeling**
* **Temporal data prediction**
* **Deep learning with Keras**
* **Dropout for regularization**
* **Evaluation via plots and metrics**

#### 📎 Notes

* Ensure your dataset is cleaned and formatted into time windows if required.
* You can adapt the model for classification or regression depending on your data.
